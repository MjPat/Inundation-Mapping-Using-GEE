# Inundation-Mapping-Using-GEE
A code that maps inundation using Google Earth Engine. It uses a function to count cloudy pixels over the AOI so that images containing cloud, but not over the AOI can remain in the image collection, increasing the number of images that can be used for accurate inundation mapping. The water index used in this code was Mcfeeter's NDWI (1996) but any index can be substituted by altering the bands in the water function. This code is an adaptation of the one used in study :Condeça, Joaquim, João Nascimento, and Nuno Barreiras. "Monitoring the storage volume of water reservoirs using Google Earth Engine." Water Resources Research 58, no. 3 (2022): e2021WR030026. 
The code used in the study can be found at :

Some changes include the way the images that had cloud over the AOI were removed from the collection. The method used in the study mentioned did not perform uniformly accross the temporal scale of my study, so it was altered. My study included Landsat 1, 2, 3 (MSS), Landsat 4,5 (TM) and Landsat 8,9 (OLI).
